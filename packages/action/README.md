### Native dependency caches

Explicit native system packages enter one dependency plan. For example,
`openjdk.org@17.0.20.8 android.com/cmdline-tools@14742923.0.0` keeps JDK 17
selected while satisfying Android's `>=17` runtime dependency.
Pantry exports `JAVA_HOME` for the selected JDK and puts its matching native
libraries first. Java-dependent launchers such as `sdkmanager` use that runtime.
Activated commands can be native forwarding launchers or links. The Action
resolves the package executable through Pantry's activation contract before
deriving a JDK home or MySQL base directory. Executable activation preserves the
package's own resource paths when commands run through `.bin`.

The cache identity includes the Pantry version, platform, project manifests,
lockfile, and registry artifact digests for native packages and their runtime
dependencies. Rebuilding a package at the same version therefore invalidates
its previous cached installation. Restore keys retain the artifact identity;
they cannot restore an older binary after a registry rebuild.

When the registry cannot establish a verified dependency graph, the action
reports the reason and installs normally without restoring or saving a native
dependency cache. It does not treat an uncertain cache as a valid installation.
Pin the action to a release commit in production workflows.

On runners without an Actions cache service, Pantry skips cache metadata
lookups, restore requests and archive creation. Packages still install through
the same native resolver. A successful cache save is reported only when the
cache service returns an accepted cache ID.

Native registry GETs retry gateway responses (502, 503 and 504) at most twice,
using the same endpoint and credential scope within the original request
deadline. Authentication failures and missing packages remain terminal. A
failed install still fails the job after recovery is exhausted.

### Build dependency archive caching

The repository's mirror, source-build, sync, and publish workflows enable
`PANTRY_CACHE_BUILD_DEPENDENCIES: 'true'`. Setup Pantry exports the job's masked
Actions cache credentials for subsequent Bun build scripts. Other workflows can
opt in with `cache-build-dependencies: 'true'` on the action.

`build-package.ts` and `download-from-s3.ts` fetch current metadata, then reuse
the exact SHA-256 archive from a local cache or GitHub Actions. Every hit is
hashed again. A rebuild at the same version with a new digest downloads new
bytes. Extraction and pkg-config rewriting happen separately for each build.
Only the verified archive is cached; credentials, signed URLs, metadata, and
extracted prefixes are excluded. GitHub entries are saved immediately, so a
later build failure does not discard downloaded dependencies.

The local cache defaults to `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/.cache/pantry-build-archives/v1`
in CI, or `~/.cache/pantry-build-archives/v1` locally. Set
`PANTRY_BUILD_ARCHIVE_CACHE_DIR` to override it and
`PANTRY_BUILD_ARCHIVE_CACHE_MAX_BYTES` to change its 4 GiB limit. Old archives
are evicted after the requesting build receives its copy. Child build processes
share a lock so they do not download the same dependency concurrently.

Each GitHub entry contains one archive under an exact digest key, shared across
workflows within GitHub's branch/cache scope and subject to normal cache
eviction. Parallel cold runners can each download an archive before the first
save completes. No repository cache quota increase is required. Cache outages
fall back to object storage; checksum failures remain fatal.

The action's job summary reports local/GitHub hits, object-storage archive bytes
written, failed downloads, avoided repeat bytes, and the largest origin
dependencies. Metadata and upstream recipe downloads are excluded; these
counters are estimates rather than the provider's bill. Run the manual
**Verify Shared Build Dependency Cache** workflow to populate real dependency
archives and require successful reuse on a fresh runner with origin archive
downloads disabled. This path uses the configured S3-compatible provider and
continues to work if storage later moves to R2.

### Windows Git provisioning

On Windows, `git-scm.org@2.53.0` resolves to the official complete MinGit
`2.53.0+windows.1` bundle for x64 or ARM64. The SDK verifies the publisher's
archive digest, retains the original digests for this adopted release, and
keeps the vendor revision in the installed identity. The bundle's `cmd/git.exe`
receives a relative `.bin/git.exe` alias; its runtime resources stay in place.
Unix Git continues to use the native dependency graph.

The required `windows-git` CI job builds the source Action and checks a cold
installation, native Git commands, submodules, HTTPS, relocation and a cache
round trip. Its logs and execution receipt are uploaded as `windows-git-proof`.
Data-only archive checks on another host do not establish Windows execution.
The generic native CLI Windows Git package path remains a separate capability.

### Linux browser installation checks

The `native-browser` CI job builds the CLI from the checkout and installs
`git-scm.org@2.53.0 google.com/chrome@155.0.8059.84` through the ordinary
native dependency resolver. It runs as an unprivileged user with private XDG
data and cache directories, then checks the installed Chrome executable and
version. The release gate requires this job to pass.

To run the same check on Linux after building the CLI:

```bash
PANTRY_TEST_CLI=packages/zig/zig-out/bin/pantry bun .github/scripts/linux-native-browser.ts
```

The check retains verbose installation logs and a CLI/executable identity
receipt under `artifacts/linux-native-browser/`, including on failure, and
removes its private installation. It verifies installation and activation;
applications still need their own browser startup and page tests.

### Health-checked Redis

Use the service input when tests need Redis. Pantry installs the exact requested
Redis package, binds it only to loopback, disables persistence for the ephemeral
runner, allocates a private port and random password, waits for authenticated
`PONG` and server identity, and stops only its owned process after the job.
`REDIS_URL`, `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_USERNAME`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, `REDISCLI_AUTH`
and `REDIS_SERVICE_VERSION` describe that instance.
The URL names Redis's `default` ACL user explicitly; an empty username is a
different user for clients that send two-argument `AUTH`. Both URL-based and
environment-based authentication are verified against the real service.

Foreground startup records the process identity, then waits up to 30 seconds
for an authenticated `redis-cli ping`. A startup
failure includes the Redis logfile in the Actions error so port collisions,
binary linkage failures, and invalid configuration are directly diagnosable.

```yaml
- name: Setup Pantry and Redis
  uses: pantry-pm/pantry/packages/action@main
  with:
    install: 'false'
    services: redis@8.8.0

- run: bun test
```

The action fails before tests when the installed version differs from the exact
service pin or Redis does not become ready. `redis-url` and `redis-version` are
also available as action outputs. Pin both the action revision and the Pantry
binary `version` in release-sensitive workflows so source and CLI behavior are
independently reproducible.

### PostgreSQL, MySQL and Typesense

Pantry installs the complete native dependency graph, creates private service
data for each action invocation, allocates loopback ports and checks the running
versions. PostgreSQL readiness includes an authenticated SQL query. MySQL
readiness verifies the private data directory and an authenticated TLS session; Typesense
readiness includes an authenticated API request. The post action stops the
owned services and removes their private data, including after a failed job.

Startup saves private-directory ownership before readiness checks. A gated
foreground launcher starts the native server only after its PID, user, birth,
command and process group have been saved for the post action. Cancellation
before that checkpoint starts no server. Cleanup signals only the verified
owned group and checks that its live members have exited before removing data.
Changed ownership or incomplete shutdown fails cleanup and retains the data.

```yaml
- name: Set up the native test stack
  uses: pantry-pm/pantry/packages/action@main
  with:
    install: 'false'
    packages: bun.sh@1.4.2
    services: postgres@17.11 mysql@26.7.0 typesense@30.2
```

PostgreSQL exports `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`,
`POSTGRES_URL` and `POSTGRES_SERVICE_VERSION`. MySQL exports `MYSQL_HOST`,
`MYSQL_PORT`, `MYSQL_USER`, `MYSQL_PASSWORD`, `MYSQL_DATABASE`, `MYSQL_SSL_CA`,
`MYSQL_URL` (with `ssl=true`) and `MYSQL_SERVICE_VERSION`. Its disposable user
can create and drop test databases; TCP connections require encryption. Native
Bun clients can use the URL directly or pass `{ tls: true }` explicitly;
both forms are checked against the live encrypted session. The URL flag also
supplies SSL configuration to framework drivers. Typesense exports
`TYPESENSE_HOST`, `TYPESENSE_PORT`, `TYPESENSE_PROTOCOL`, `TYPESENSE_API_KEY`,
`TYPESENSE_URL` and `TYPESENSE_SERVICE_VERSION`. Credentials are random per job
and masked in action logs. `postgres-url`, `postgres-version`, `typesense-url`
`mysql-url`, `mysql-version` and `typesense-version` are also action outputs. Keep these services on the
provided addresses; no fixed host ports or pre-existing databases are needed.

### DynamoDB Local

Use `services: dynamodb@3.3.0` on Linux x86-64. `dynamodb-local` and
`aws.amazon.com/dynamodb-local` select the same native provider. The Pantry
release must contain this provider's catalog and service API so its JVM and
launcher utilities are installed through Pantry, rather than supplied by the
runner image. Other platforms fail before a service starts.

The action allocates a private port and database directory, verifies the actual
version, and exercises table creation, item writes, consistent reads and table
deletion before returning the endpoint. Every readiness connection must belong
to the recorded service group before HTTP bytes are sent. Post cleanup stops
that owned group and removes its data using the same ownership checks as the
other services.

`DYNAMODB_URL`, `DYNAMODB_HOST`, `DYNAMODB_PORT`, `DYNAMODB_SERVICE_VERSION`,
`DYNAMODB_REGION`, `DYNAMODB_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `DYNAMODB_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
describe the test instance. `dynamodb-url` and `dynamodb-version` are action
outputs. Configure the test client with those values; the action preserves
existing `AWS_*` credentials and region settings.

DynamoDB Local is a development server without AWS cloud authentication. The
exported credentials are local placeholders. The action connects over loopback;
it does not change the upstream server's listener bind behavior.

### Apple code signing

A macOS runner starts with no signing identities, so `codesign` and
`productbuild` have nothing to sign with. Set `apple-signing: 'true'` and the
Action imports your certificates into a temporary keychain before the build,
then deletes that keychain when the job ends — including when the job fails.

```yaml
- name: Set up signing
  id: signing
  uses: pantry-pm/pantry/packages/action@v0.11.0
  with:
    apple-signing: 'true'
    apple-signing-application-certificate: ${{ secrets.APPLE_APPLICATION_CERTIFICATE }}
    apple-signing-installer-certificate: ${{ secrets.APPLE_INSTALLER_CERTIFICATE }}
    apple-signing-certificate-password: ${{ secrets.APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD }}
    apple-signing-provisioning-profile: ${{ secrets.APPLE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE }}

- name: Build and sign
  run: bun run build
  env:
    # Also available as steps.signing.outputs.apple-signing-identity
    SIGN_IDENTITY: ${{ env.APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY }}
    INSTALLER_IDENTITY: ${{ env.APPLE_INSTALLER_SIGNING_IDENTITY }}
    PROVISIONING_PROFILE: ${{ env.APPLE_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_PATH }}
```

Certificates are base64-encoded `.p12` files (`base64 -i cert.p12 | pbcopy`).
The exact certificate fingerprints are discovered from the imported identities
and published as outputs and `APPLE_*` environment variables, so duplicate
common names in other keychains cannot make signing ambiguous. Human-readable
identity names remain in the logs. Generate the certificates and profile with
`pantry app-store:csr` and `pantry app-store:provision --apply`.

### GitHub, Mac App Store, and S3 releases

Pantry can keep a GitHub release as the source of truth while delivering the
same signed package to App Store Connect and mirroring every artifact to AWS
S3, Backblaze B2, or Hetzner Object Storage. The Action first creates a GitHub
draft and verifies its artifacts. It then validates/uploads the App Store
package, mirrors the release, attaches provider receipts, and only then
publishes the GitHub release.

```yaml
- name: Publish release
  uses: pantry-pm/pantry/packages/action@v0.11.0
  with:
    install: 'false'
    release: 'true'
    release-files: |
      dist/Postline.pkg
      dist/Postline.dmg
    release-checksums: sha256
    release-app-store: 'true'
    release-app-store-bundle-id: com.example.postline
    release-app-store-version: ${{ github.ref_name }}
    release-app-store-build-number: ${{ github.run_number }}
    release-app-store-api-key-id: ${{ secrets.APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID }}
    release-app-store-issuer-id: ${{ secrets.APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID }}
    release-app-store-private-key: ${{ secrets.APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY }}
    release-s3: 'true'
    release-s3-provider: hetzner
    release-s3-bucket: app-releases
    release-s3-region: fsn1
    release-s3-public-url: https://downloads.example.com
    release-s3-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    release-s3-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The Mac App Store target requires a macOS runner and a package signed with a
Mac Installer Distribution certificate. The API key is written to an
owner-only temporary directory for `xcrun altool` and removed after delivery.
Create a dedicated App Store Connect API key with only the roles needed to
upload and manage this app; store its ID, issuer ID, and private key as
repository or organization secrets. For object storage, scope the access key
to the configured bucket/prefix and grant only object read/write/list access.
The object-storage target streams files from disk, retries stalled uploads,
verifies remote sizes, writes immutable versioned objects, and writes
`latest.json` with `no-cache`.

Every release includes `release-manifest.json` with SHA-256 hashes. Enabled
targets also attach `app-store-receipt.json` and/or
`s3-release-receipt.json`. To validate the release plan without creating a
GitHub release or making provider network changes, set `release-dry-run:
'true'`.
