/**
 * Object-storage-backed analytics.
 *
 * Keeps the aggregate analytics model (per-package stats, daily counts, category
 * counts, missing-version requests) in memory and persists it as a single JSON
 * object in the storage bucket — the same durable pattern as ObjectMetadataStorage.
 * This replaces the ephemeral InMemoryAnalytics used in production (which lost all
 * tracking on every restart) and the DynamoDB analytics, so download tracking
 * survives restarts and runs fully off AWS.
 *
 * The registry is single-instance, so an in-memory model with debounced, serialized
 * writes is safe. Tracking calls are fire-and-forget and very frequent, so writes
 * are debounced (counters accumulate in memory between flushes).
