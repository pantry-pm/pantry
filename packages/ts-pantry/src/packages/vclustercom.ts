 * **vcluster** - vCluster - Create fully functional virtual Kubernetes clusters - Each vcluster runs inside a namespace of the underlying k8s cluster. It's cheaper than creating separate full-blown clusters and it offers better multi-tenancy and isolation than regular namespaces.
 *
 * @domain `vcluster.com`
 * @programs `vcluster`
 * @version `0.33.0` (65 versions available)
 * @versions From newest version to oldest.
 *
 * @install `pantry install vcluster.com`
 * @homepage https://www.vcluster.com
 * @dependencies `kubernetes.io/kubectl^1`, `linux:curl.se/ca-certs` (includes OS-specific dependencies with `os:package` format)
 * @buildDependencies `go.dev@^1.21`, `linux:gnu.org/gcc`, `linux:gnu.org/binutils@~2.44` (includes OS-specific dependencies with `os:package` format) - required only when building from source
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { pantry } from 'ts-pantry'
 *
 * const pkg = pantry.vclustercom
 * console.log(pkg.name)        // "vcluster"
 * console.log(pkg.description) // "vCluster - Create fully functional virtual Kube..."
