# Introduction to ts-pantry

> A TypeScript library for fetching and working with Pantry package information

ts-pantry is a specialized library that provides tools for fetching, storing, and accessing package data from Pantry. It offers both programmatic APIs and CLI tools for developers who want to work with Pantry packages in their TypeScript applications.

## What is Pantry

Pantry is a package manager that simplifies the installation of development tools and dependencies. It provides a central repository of packages that can be easily installed and managed.

## Core Features

- **Package Fetching**: Retrieve detailed package information from Pantry
- **TypeScript Integration**: Fully typed interfaces for all package data (see [TypeScript Types](./typescript-types.md))
- **Multiple Package Fetching**: Fetch multiple specific packages at once with the `--pkg` option
- **Optimized Batch Processing**: Efficiently process hundreds of packages with configurable concurrency
- **CLI Tools**: Comprehensive command line utilities for fetching and managing packages
- **Alias Support**: Handle package aliases (e.g., "node" for "nodejs.org")
- **Nested Paths**: Support for packages with nested paths (e.g., "agwa.name/git-crypt")
- **Smart Caching**: Configurable caching system to improve performance and avoid hitting rate limits
- **TypeScript Code Generation**: Convert package data into TypeScript files for easy use
- **Index Generation**: Automatically create indexes for easy access to all packages
- **JSON Output**: Option to output as JSON instead of TypeScript
- **Compiled Binaries**: Use pre-compiled binaries for various platforms
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Robust error handling with automatic retries

## Why ts-pantry

ts-pantry simplifies the process of working with Pantry package data in TypeScript projects. Instead of manually scraping the Pantry website or trying to parse package information yourself, ts-pantry provides a clean, type-safe interface for accessing this data.

## Get Started

To start using ts-pantry in your project, check out the [Installation](./install.md) guide.

```bash
# Install with bun
bun install ts-pantry

# Quick example: fetch package info
bun run pkgx:fetch node
```

## Project Structure

The project follows a clean and maintainable structure:

- `src/`: Source code for the library
  - `packages/`: Package definitions and utilities
  - `tools/`: Utility scripts for package handling
  - `types.ts`: TypeScript interfaces
- `bin/`: CLI tools
- `test/`: Comprehensive test suite
