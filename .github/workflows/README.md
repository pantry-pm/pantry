# GitHub Actions

The main entry points are:

- [CI](ci.yml): lint, type checks and the test suite.
- [Release](release.yml): build the native CLI for every supported release target and publish the public TypeScript package.
- [Publish changed packages](publish-changed-packages.yml): publish the recipes changed by a commit, or an explicitly selected package and version.
- [Mirror](mirror.yml): incrementally publish missing vendor archives and download recipes.
- [Published native runtime smoke](native-runtime-smoke.yml): install public browser and media artifacts into a fresh prefix, encode H.264/AAC, and load real HTTPS through Bun WebView.
- [Registry integrity](registry-integrity.yml): check the published registry's integrity.

## Native package publication

Linux x64 and ARM packages run on matching Linux runners. Darwin ARM packages run on macOS, including recipes that download an upstream binary. A vendor archive still needs native Mach-O inspection, loader normalization and any required runtime health checks. A Linux download does not replace those checks.

The targeted publisher and the manual Build, Build Multi-Version Packages and Sync Pre-Built Binaries workflows select their native tools through `native-publisher-toolchain.ts` and install them through the Pantry action. Tool verification rejects a host executable or an entry outside the managed prefix. Recipe dependencies supply additional compilers, build tools and libraries; the macOS runner supplies Apple’s licensed SDK. These publishing workflows do not bootstrap through apt, Homebrew, pip, rustup or Docker.

Both the scheduled mirror and targeted publisher follow this rule. The targeted publisher preserves exact `domain@version` selectors when handing work to the macOS job. Custom recipes retain their own build configuration even when a vendor prebuilt exists.

For a bounded repair, dispatch **Publish changed packages** with an exact selector such as `bun.com@1.4.3`, a platform, and the number of versions to publish. Leave `platform` empty for all supported publisher platforms. `linux` selects both Linux architectures; `darwin-arm64` selects the native Mac job.

A successful matrix leg does not imply that the requested package supports that platform. For example, Chrome's recipe supports Linux x64. Confirm the actual uploaded package, version and platform in the publication receipt, then install the public artifact into a fresh consumer and run its required programs. Do not infer an ARM Chrome artifact from an otherwise successful ARM job.

## CLI release verification

Verify the actual public assets and their digests after a CLI release. The native executable should report the released version and source revision. Verify the public npm metadata and tarball integrity separately; an accepted asynchronous npm publication can precede availability from the public registry.

## Automated catalog recovery

Update Packages leases publisher notifications for two hours, longer than its 100-minute job budget. The registry persists each lease before responding. A repeated claim by the same workflow run returns the same lease. Failed runs leave their lease unacknowledged; expiry makes those domains available again. An acknowledgement removes only that lease, preserving releases reported while it was running. Claimed-only runs fail when leasing is unavailable; full sweeps can continue without consuming the queue. The new `/api/rebuild-queue/lease` endpoint prevents an updated workflow from accidentally consuming the old destructive claim API before the registry deployment finishes.

The updater commits publication requests under `.github/catalog-publications/` with its metadata and generated catalogs. Recover Catalog Publications runs after updater/publisher completion and hourly. It dispatches each pending request against its exact landed source commit, waits for completed native publication jobs, and records a lightweight `catalog-published/<request-id>` receipt tag pointing to that source. Receipts survive Actions log retention; the next update removes acknowledged request files. A dropped dispatch, failed build, or crash after landing leaves the committed request available for recovery. Running publications are left alone. Failed publications wait an hour between retries; after three failed attempts the workflow reports a failure and retains the request. Inspect the build diagnostics, repair the cause, then rerun the failed publisher or dispatch recovery with `retry-failed=true`.

The desktop recorder fetches full history and invokes checked-push only when recording actually created a commit. Checked-push verifies its specific CI run and retries transient API reads/status writes up to four attempts within the original deadline. Authentication and permission failures fail immediately; non-idempotent publication dispatches are reconciled from run history rather than blindly retried.
