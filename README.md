# pantry

> A modern dependency manager for your system and your projects. Effortlessly manage development tools, runtime environments, and project dependencies with automatic environment isolation. _Think Homebrew meets project-aware dependency management._

## What is pantry

pantry is a comprehensive dependency management solution that bridges the gap between system-wide package management and project-specific environments. Whether you're setting up a new development machine, managing system tools, or working on projects with specific dependency requirements, pantry provides a unified interface for all your dependency needs.

**System Management:**

- Install and manage development tools system-wide
- Automatic PATH configuration and shell integration
- Cross-platform compatibility _(macOS, Linux, Windows)_
- Smart permission handling and installation paths

**Project Management:**

- Automatic project environment detection and activation
- Isolated dependency environments per project
- Version-specific tool installation
- Seamless switching between project contexts

At its core, pantry hosts its own package registry with 1700+ system packages, 50+ desktop apps, and pre-built binaries — all served from CDN. No external dependency managers required.

## Features

pantry transforms how you manage dependencies across your entire development workflow:

### System-Wide Dependency Management

- 📦 **Global Tool Installation** — Install development tools and runtimes system-wide with automatic PATH management
- 🔧 **Smart Installation Paths** — Automatically chooses `/usr/local` for system-wide access or `~/.local` for user-specific installs (pkgm compatible)
- 🔌 **Shell Integration** — Seamless integration with your shell for immediate tool availability
- 🪟 **Cross-Platform Support** — Consistent experience across macOS, Linux, and Windows

### Service Management

- ⚡ **68 Pre-configured Services** — PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Prometheus, Grafana, Vault, and more
- 🚀 **One-Command Service Control** — Start, stop, restart services with automatic configuration
- 🏥 **Health Monitoring** — Built-in health checks with automatic status detection
- 🔧 **Auto-Configuration** — Default configuration files generated for each service
- 🔐 **Configurable Database Credentials** — Customize database usernames, passwords, and authentication methods
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform Service Management** — Uses launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux

### Project-Aware Environment Management

- 🌍 **Automatic Environment Isolation** — Project-specific environments that activate when you enter a project directory
- 🎯 **Dependency Detection** — Automatically reads `deps.yaml`, `dependencies.yaml`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, and other project files
- 🔄 **Context Switching** — Seamlessly switch between different project environments
- 📋 **Version Management** — Install and manage specific versions of tools per project
- 🗂️ **Environment Management** — List, inspect, clean, and remove project environments with readable identifiers

### Commit Publishing (pkg-pr-new Alternative)

- 🚀 **Publish from Any Commit** — Publish packages directly from git commits without version bumps
- 📦 **Monorepo Support** — Automatically discovers and publishes all packages in a monorepo
- 🔗 **Instant Install URLs** — Get shareable install URLs for every published commit
- 🤖 **CI/CD Ready** — Drop-in replacement for `pkg-pr-new` in GitHub Actions

### Paid Packages

- 💳 **Charge for What You Publish** — `pantry price set my-package 9.00`; metadata stays public, the tarball is gated
- 🧾 **Purchases Follow the Account** — buy once, install on every machine; on Team, one purchase covers everyone with a seat
- 🆓 **Free Versions** — keep a 1.x free while charging for 2.x, with `--free-versions`
- 🏦 **Direct Payouts** — Stripe Connect payouts to the publisher, with a configurable platform fee

### For Teams

- 🛡️ **Build Insurance** — `pantry insure` mirrors every artifact you install into your own namespace; an unpublished or retagged dependency can't break your build
- 🚨 **Continuous Alerts** — your lockfile watched against the OSV advisory database plus your own licence policy, not just when you remember to audit
- 📜 **SBOM Export** — CycloneDX or SPDX with hashes computed from the bytes we stored, deterministic so it doesn't churn your repo
- 👥 **Team Seats** — up to 10 people share one account's packages, mirror, watch list, and paid-package purchases

### Private Registries

- 🔒 **Private by Default** — `pantry registry setup` stands up your own registry where nothing — metadata, tarballs, binaries, search, the UI — is served without a credential
- 🎟️ **Read-Only Tokens** — Mint per-person and per-machine tokens, scoped to `read` or `publish`, revocable instantly
- 🧩 **Extensible** — Add routes and access policies (SSO, IP allowlists, per-team packages) as [plugins](https://pantry.dev/registry-extensions), no fork of the server required
- 🏠 **Runs Anywhere** — One Bun process plus any S3-compatible bucket (Hetzner, Backblaze, MinIO, AWS); no AWS account needed

### Desktop Apps

- 🖥️ **50+ Desktop Apps** — Install VS Code, Discord, Obsidian, Spotify, and more via `pantry install`
- 📦 **Same Pipeline** — Apps go through the same registry as system packages (S3 + metadata)
- 🔄 **Daily Updates** — Desktop apps checked and rebuilt daily via GitHub Actions
- 🌐 **Browse All** — `curl https://registry.pantry.dev/desktop-apps | jq`

### Developer Experience

- ⚡ **Fast Operations** — Native Zig CLI with pre-built binaries from CDN
- 🗑️ **Clean Removal** — Remove packages or completely uninstall with proper cleanup
- ⬆️ **Self-Update** — `pantry upgrade` to get the latest version, `--canary` for pre-releases
- 🎛️ **Flexible Configuration** — Customize behavior through config files or command-line options

## Why pantry

Modern development requires managing dependencies at multiple levels - from system tools to project-specific requirements. Traditional approaches fall short:

**Traditional Package Managers (Homebrew, apt, etc.):**

- ❌ **Global conflicts** — Different projects need different versions
- ❌ **Slow operations** — Installing or updating can take minutes
- ❌ **Manual environment management** — Switching between project contexts is manual
- ❌ **PATH pollution** — All tools are globally available, causing conflicts

**Manual Dependency Management:**

- ❌ **Inconsistent setups** — Different team members have different environments
- ❌ **Complex PATH management** — Manual shell configuration is error-prone
- ❌ **Version drift** — Hard to maintain consistent tool versions
- ❌ **Platform differences** — Different setup procedures for each OS

**pantry's Solution:**

- ✅ **Unified Management** — Single tool for both system and project dependencies
- ✅ **Automatic Isolation** — Project environments activate automatically
- ✅ **Fast Operations** — Efficient package management with intelligent caching
- ✅ **Consistent Experience** — Same commands and behavior across all platforms
- ✅ **Smart Defaults** — Sensible installation paths and configuration out of the box

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pantry.dev | bash
```

That's it. This downloads the latest pre-built binary for your platform, installs it to `~/.local/bin`, and configures your PATH.

To install a specific version:

```bash
export PANTRY_VERSION=0.8.7 && curl -fsSL https://pantry.dev | bash
```

To install to a custom location:

```bash
export PANTRY_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin && curl -fsSL https://pantry.dev | bash
```

## Quick Start

After installing, bootstrap your shell integration:

```bash
pantry bootstrap
```

This sets up:

- Shell integration for automatic project environment activation
- PATH configuration
- Global tool management

### System-Wide Tool Management

Install and manage development tools across your entire system:

```bash
# Install essential development tools system-wide
pantry install node python go rust

# Install specific versions
pantry install node@22 python@3.12

# Install to /usr/local (default system-wide location)
pantry install typescript --system

# Or specify any custom path
pantry install docker --path /opt/tools

# Use shorthand for quick installs
pantry i node@22 typescript@5.7
```

**Smart Installation Behavior:**

- **Default**: Installs to `/usr/local` if writable, otherwise `~/.local`
- **System-wide**: Use `--system` for explicit system installation (same as default)
- **Custom paths**: Use `--path <directory>` for any location
- **Automatic PATH**: Tools are immediately available in new shells

### Project Environment Management

pantry automatically manages project-specific dependencies:

```bash
# Create a project with dependencies
echo "dependencies:

  - node@22
  - typescript@5.7
  - bun@1.2" > dependencies.yaml

# Environment activates automatically when you enter the directory
cd my-project
# → ✅ Environment activated for /path/to/my-project

# Tools are available in project context
node --version  # Uses project-specific Node.js
tsc --version   # Uses project-specific TypeScript

# Leave project - environment deactivates automatically
cd ..
# → 🔄 Environment deactivated
```

Learn more: [Environment Management](https://pantry.dev/features/environment-management), [Package Management](https://pantry.dev/features/package-management), [Configuration](https://pantry.dev/config), [FAQ](https://pantry.dev/faq).

**Supported Project Files:**

- `deps.yaml` / `deps.yml`
- `dependencies.yaml` / `dependencies.yml`
- `pantry.yaml` / `pantry.yml`
- `pkgx.yaml` / `pkgx.yml`
- `package.json` (Node.js projects)
- `pyproject.toml` (Python projects)
- `Cargo.toml` (Rust projects)
- And more...

### Environment Management

Manage your project environments with human-readable identifiers:

```bash
# List all development environments
pantry env:list

# Inspect a specific environment
pantry env:inspect my-project_1a2b3c4d-d89abc12

# Clean up old or failed environments
pantry env:clean --dry-run

# Remove a specific environment
pantry env:remove old-project_5e6f7g8h --force
```

**Environment Hash Format:** `{project-name}_{8-char-hex}-d{8-char-dep-hash}`

- `final-project_7db6cf06-d89abc12` - Project path hash plus dependency fingerprint
- `working-test_208a31ec-d1029a7b` - Human-readable with version-aware suffix
- `my-app_1a2b3c4d-deadbeef` - Collision-resistant, version-switching on cd

### Package Management

Remove packages and manage your installation:

```bash
# Remove specific system tools
pantry remove node python

# Remove project-specific versions (using uninstall command)
pantry uninstall node@22

# See what would be removed
pantry uninstall python --dry-run

# Complete system cleanup
pantry clean --force
```

### Service Management

Manage development services with ease:

```bash
# Start essential development services
pantry start postgres redis

# Start multiple services at once
pantry start postgres redis nginx prometheus

# Check service status
pantry status postgres
pantry services

# Stop services when done
pantry stop postgres redis

# Enable auto-start for essential services
pantry enable postgres redis
```

#### Configure services in deps.yaml

Add services to your dependency file to auto-start when the project environment activates:

```yaml
# deps.yaml
dependencies:

  - node@22
  - postgresql@15

services:
  enabled: true
  autoStart:

    - postgres
    - redis

```

#### Database Configuration

Customize database credentials for all database services:

```bash
# Configure database credentials globally
export pantry_DB_USERNAME="myuser"
export pantry_DB_PASSWORD="mypassword"
export pantry_DB_AUTH_METHOD="md5"  # PostgreSQL: trust|md5|scram-sha-256

# Start databases with custom credentials
pantry start postgres mysql
# Creates project-specific databases with your configured credentials
```

**Default Credentials** (secure for development):

- Username: `root`
- Password: `password`
- Auth Method: `trust` (PostgreSQL)

**Configuration Options:**

- Environment variables: `pantry_DB_USERNAME`, `pantry_DB_PASSWORD`, `pantry_DB_AUTH_METHOD`
- Config file: `pantry.config.ts` → `services.database`
- Per-project databases automatically created with your credentials

### Commit Publishing

Publish packages directly from git commits — a built-in replacement for `pkg-pr-new`:

```bash
# Publish all packages in a monorepo from the current commit
pantry publish:commit './packages/_'

# Publish a single package
pantry publish:commit ./my-package

# Dry run to see what would be published
pantry publish:commit './packages/_' --dry-run

# Use a custom registry
pantry publish:commit './packages/*' --registry https://registry.example.com
```

Each published package gets an install URL tied to the commit SHA:

```bash
# Install a specific commit's package
npm install https://registry.pantry.dev/commits/abc1234/@scope/my-package/tarball
```

**GitHub Actions integration** — replace `pkg-pr-new` in your CI:

```yaml
# Before (pkg-pr-new)

- run: bunx pkg-pr-new publish './packages/_'

# After (pantry)

- run: pantry publish:commit './packages/_'

```

### Desktop Apps

```bash
# Install desktop apps (same as system packages)
pantry install discord
pantry install obsidian
pantry install code.visualstudio.com

# Browse available apps
curl https://registry.pantry.dev/desktop-apps | jq
curl https://registry.pantry.dev/desktop-apps?category=Development | jq
```

### Self-Update

```bash
# Upgrade pantry to the latest stable release
pantry upgrade

# Upgrade to the latest canary (pre-release) build
pantry upgrade --canary

# Check what would be upgraded without making changes
pantry upgrade --dry-run
```

### Advanced Operations

```bash
# Create executable shims
pantry shim node@22 typescript@5.7

# List all installed packages
pantry list

# Update packages
pantry update node python --latest

# Cache management
pantry cache:stats     # Show cache statistics
