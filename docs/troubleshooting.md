# Troubleshooting

This guide helps you diagnose and resolve common issues with pantry. Most problems can be solved quickly with the right diagnostic commands.

## Quick Diagnostics

### Check pantry Status

```bash
# Verify pantry is installed and working
pantry --version

# Check current configuration
pantry list --verbose

# Test shell integration
type __pantry_chpwd || echo "Shell integration not working"
```

### Environment Status

```bash
# Check current environment
echo "Environment hash: $pantry_ENV_HASH"
echo "Project name: $pantry_PROJECT_NAME"

# List all environments
pantry env:list

# Check for dependency files
ls -la {dependencies,pkgx,deps}.{yaml,yml} .{pantry,pkgx,deps}.{yaml,yml} 2>/dev/null
```

## Installation Issues

### Package Not Found

**Symptoms:**

- Error: "Package 'xyz' not found"
- Installation fails immediately

**Solutions:**

1. **Check package name and version:**

   ```bash
# Try different package name formats
   pantry install node@22      # Standard format
   pantry install nodejs.org@22  # With domain
   pantry install node         # Latest version
   ```

2. **Verify with pantry's search:**

   ```bash
   pantry search node
   pantry info node
   ```

3. **Use verbose mode for details:**

   ```bash
   pantry install --verbose node@22
   ```

### Permission Denied Errors

**Symptoms:**

- "Permission denied" when installing
- "EACCES" errors
- Installation fails after asking for password

**Solutions:**

1. **Check installation directory permissions:**

   ```bash
   ls -la /usr/local/
   ls -la ~/.local/
   ```

2. **Fix /usr/local permissions:**

   ```bash
   sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin
   ```

3. **Use user-local installation:**

   ```bash
   pantry install --path ~/.local node@22
   ```

4. **Verify PATH includes user directories:**

   ```bash
   echo $PATH | grep -E "(\.local/bin|\.local/sbin)"
   ```

### Network/Download Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Timeouts during installation
- Download failures
- "Connection refused" errors

**Solutions:**

1. **Check internet connection:**

   ```bash
   curl -I https://pkgx.sh
   ```

2. **Increase timeout:**

   ```bash
   pantry install --timeout 120000 node@22  # 2 minutes
   ```

3. **Try different mirror or later:**

   ```bash
# Sometimes pkgx mirrors are temporarily down
# Wait a few minutes and try again
   ```

## Environment Issues

### Environment Not Activating

**Symptoms:**

- No activation message when entering directories
- Environment variables not set
- Wrong package versions in project

**Diagnosis:**

1. **Check shell integration:**

   ```bash
# Should show function definition
   type __pantry_chpwd

# Check shell config
   grep "pantry dev:shellcode" ~/.zshrc ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **Verify dependency file:**

   ```bash
# Check file exists and has correct syntax
   cat dependencies.yaml
   pantry dev:dump --dryrun --verbose
   ```

3. **Test manual activation:**

   ```bash
   pantry dev:on
   ```

**Solutions:**

1. **Set up shell integration:**

   ```bash
   echo 'eval "$(pantry dev:shellcode)"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. **Fix dependency file syntax:**

   ```yaml
# Correct format
   dependencies:

     - node@22
     - python@3.12

   env:
     NODE_ENV: development
   ```

3. **Reload shell environment:**

   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
# Or restart your terminal
   ```

### Shell Messages Not Showing

**Symptoms:**

- Environment activates but no messages appear
- Silent activation/deactivation

**Solutions:**

1. **Check message settings:**

   ```bash
   echo $pantry_SHOW_ENV_MESSAGES
   ```

2. **Enable messages:**

   ```bash
   export pantry_SHOW_ENV_MESSAGES=true
   ```

3. **Test custom messages:**

   ```bash
   export pantry_SHELL_ACTIVATION_MESSAGE="🔧 Environment ready: {path}"
   cd my-project/  # Should show custom message
   ```

### Wrong Package Versions

**Symptoms:**

- Project uses global versions instead of project-specific
- `node --version` shows unexpected version

**Solutions:**

1. **Check environment activation:**

   ```bash
   echo $pantry_ENV_HASH  # Should not be empty
   which node  # Should point to environment directory
   ```

2. **Verify PATH order:**

   ```bash
   echo $PATH
# Environment directories should come first
   ```

3. **Force environment reload:**

   ```bash
   cd .. && cd -  # Exit and re-enter directory
   ```

## Output & Auto-install Control

When you `cd` into a project that isn't set up yet, the shell integration runs
`pantry install` for you. By default this is **quiet**: a single transient
`pantry: setting up <name>…` line, then `pantry: <name> ready`. The full
installer log is written to `~/.pantry/last-install.log` and only the tail is
shown if setup fails. Activation itself (PATH/env changes) is silent.

Knobs (all optional):

| Variable / flag | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| `PANTRY_VERBOSE=1` | Stream the full install log on `cd` instead of the clean status line |
| `PANTRY_NO_AUTO_INSTALL=1` | Never auto-install on `cd` (you run `pantry install` yourself) |
| `PANTRY_INSTALL_TIMEOUT=<seconds>` | Cap auto-install time (requires a `timeout`/`gtimeout` binary) |
| `PANTRY_QUIET=1` | Make **every** `pantry install`/`add`/`ci` quiet (progress hidden, errors still shown) |
| `pantry install --quiet` / `-q` | One-off quiet install; also `pantry add -q`, `pantry ci -q` |
| `install.quiet = true` in `pantry.toml` | Default installs to quiet for this project |
| `pantry update --silent`, `pantry remove --silent` | Silence those commands (errors still shown) |
| `NO_COLOR=1` | Disable ANSI colors everywhere (https://no-color.org) |
| `FORCE_COLOR=1` | Keep colors even when output is piped/redirected |

Color is auto-detected: output to a real terminal is colorized; piping or
redirecting (`pantry list > out.txt`) produces plain text automatically.

```bash
# See exactly what setup did, in place, this once:
PANTRY_VERBOSE=1 cd my-project/

# Inspect the last auto-install if a cd setup failed:
cat ~/.pantry/last-install.log

# Make this project's installs quiet by default:
echo -e "[install]\nquiet = true" >> pantry.toml
```

Errors and per-package failures are **never** suppressed by quiet mode — only
progress, summaries, and headers are.

### Update checks

The shell integration checks for a newer **pantry** release in the background,
once per shell session (never on `cd`). It's fully detached so the prompt never
waits, and self-throttled to ~once/day. When a newer release exists, the next
shell prints a single line:

```
pantry: v0.10.0 available — run `pantry upgrade`
```

- Source is the GitHub releases of `pantry-pm/pantry` — the same place
  `pantry upgrade` installs from, so the notice never advertises a version
  `upgrade` can't fetch.
- `pantry upgrade` clears the notice immediately on success.
- State lives in `~/.pantry/.update-last-check` (24h throttle stamp) and
  `~/.pantry/.update-available` (present ⇒ update pending; contents = version).
- Opt out with `PANTRY_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`. Force a check anytime with
  `pantry dev:check-updates` (respects the throttle; delete the stamp to bypass).

This is separate from updating your project's **dependencies** — use
`pantry outdated` / `pantry update` for those.

## Performance Issues

### Slow Environment Activation

**Symptoms:**

- Long delay when entering directories
- Slow command execution

**Solutions:**

1. **Clean up old environments:**

   ```bash
   pantry env:clean --older-than 7
   ```

2. **Check environment size:**

   ```bash
   pantry env:list --verbose
   du -sh ~/.local/share/pantry/envs/*
   ```

3. **Remove large/unused environments:**

   ```bash
   pantry env:remove large_environment_hash --force
   ```

### Disk Space Issues

**Symptoms:**

- "No space left on device" errors
- Installation failures due to disk space

**Solutions:**

1. **Check disk usage:**

   ```bash
   df -h ~/.local/share/pantry/
   du -sh ~/.local/share/pantry/envs/*
   ```

2. **Clean up environments:**

   ```bash
# Remove old environments
   pantry env:clean --older-than 14 --force

# Remove failed installations
   pantry env:clean --force
   ```

3. **Use custom location with more space:**

   ```bash
   export pantry_ENV_BASE_DIR=/path/to/larger/disk
   ```

## Configuration Issues

### Configuration Not Loading

**Symptoms:**

- Custom settings ignored
- Default behavior despite configuration file

**Solutions:**

1. **Check configuration file location:**

   ```bash
   ls -la pantry.config.{ts,js,json} .pantryrc
   ls -la ~/.config/pantry/config.json
   ```

2. **Validate configuration syntax:**

   ```bash
# For TypeScript files
   bunx tsc --noEmit pantry.config.ts

# For JSON files
   cat .pantryrc | python -m json.tool
   ```

3. **Test configuration loading:**

   ```bash
   pantry --verbose list  # Should show resolved config
   ```

### Environment Variables Not Working

**Symptoms:**

- Custom environment variables not set
- Wrong values in project environment

**Solutions:**

1. **Check dependency file:**

   ```bash
   cat dependencies.yaml
# Verify env section syntax
   ```

2. **Test variable expansion:**

   ```bash
   pantry dev:dump --verbose
   echo $MY_CUSTOM_VAR
   ```

3. **Check for shell conflicts:**

   ```bash
# Temporarily disable other shell customizations
# and test pantry environment
   ```

## Shell Integration Issues

### Shell Integration Not Working

**Symptoms:**

- Commands like `cd` don't trigger environment changes
- Manual `pantry dev:on` works but automatic doesn't

**Solutions:**

1. **Check shell type:**

   ```bash
   echo $SHELL
   ps -p $$
   ```

2. **Verify integration code:**

   ```bash
   pantry dev:shellcode  # Should output shell functions
   ```

3. **Check for conflicts:**

   ```bash
# Look for other tools that might interfere
   grep -E "(nvm|rbenv|pyenv)" ~/.zshrc ~/.bashrc
   ```

4. **Reinstall shell integration:**

   ```bash
# Remove old integration
   sed -i '/pantry dev:shellcode/d' ~/.zshrc

# Add fresh integration
   echo 'eval "$(pantry dev:shellcode)"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

### Multiple Shell Conflicts

**Symptoms:**

- Environment doesn't activate in new shells
- Inconsistent behavior across terminals

**Solutions:**

1. **Check all shell config files:**

   ```bash
   grep "pantry" ~/.zshrc ~/.bashrc ~/.bash_profile ~/.profile
   ```

2. **Ensure consistent integration:**

   ```bash
# Add to all relevant shell configs
   for file in ~/.zshrc ~/.bashrc; do
     if [ -f "$file" ]; then
       echo 'eval "$(pantry dev:shellcode)"' >> "$file"
     fi
   done
   ```

### Starship Prompt Timeout Warnings

**Symptoms:**

- Warning messages like: `[WARN] - (starship::utils): Executing command "/.../bin/bun" timed out`
- Starship suggests: `You can set command_timeout in your config to a higher value`
- Timeout warnings when changing directories in projects

**Cause:**
Starship tries to execute pantry-managed binaries (like `bun`, `node`, etc.) to detect tool versions for the prompt. When pantry's environment is activating, these binaries might take longer to respond than Starship's default timeout allows.

**Solutions:**

1. **Increase Starship's command timeout (Recommended):**

   Add or update the `command_timeout` setting in your Starship configuration file (`~/.config/starship.toml`):

   ```toml
# Timeout for commands executed by starship (ms)
   command_timeout = 5000

# Rest of your Starship configuration
   [git_branch]
   symbol = "🌱 "

   [bun]
   symbol = "🐰 "
   ```

2. **Test the fix:**

   ```bash
# Restart your shell or source your config
   source ~/.zshrc

# Change directories to trigger environment activation
   cd ~/my-project
   ```

3. **Alternative: Disable specific modules:**

   If you don't need version detection for certain tools, you can disable them:

   ```toml
   [bun]
   disabled = true

   [nodejs]
   disabled = true
   ```

**Note:** A 5000ms (5-second) timeout is generous and should eliminate timeout warnings while still keeping your prompt responsive. The actual execution time is typically under 1 second.

## Uninstall/Cleanup Issues

### Complete Removal

**Symptoms:**

- Want to completely remove pantry
- Start fresh after problems

**Solutions:**

1. **Use uninstall command:**

   ```bash
   pantry uninstall --force
   ```

2. **Manual cleanup:**

   ```bash
# Remove packages
   rm -rf ~/.local/bin/pkgx ~/.local/bin/bun
   rm -rf ~/.local/share/pantry/

# Remove shell integration
   sed -i '/pantry/d' ~/.zshrc ~/.bashrc

# Remove global package
   npm uninstall -g ts-pantry
   ```

3. **Clean PATH:**

   ```bash
# Edit shell config to remove pantry paths
# Restart terminal
   ```

## Service Management Issues

### Service Won't Start

**Symptoms**: Service fails to start or immediately stops
**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Check if service binary is available
which postgres
which redis-server

# Check service logs
tail -f ~/.local/share/pantry/logs/postgres.log

# Check port availability
lsof -i :5432  # Check if PostgreSQL port is in use
```

**Common Causes**:

1. **Missing binary**: Install the service package first
2. **Port conflict**: Another service is using the same port
3. **Permission issues**: Data directory not writable
4. **Configuration errors**: Invalid service configuration

**Solutions**:

```bash
# Install missing service packages
pantry install postgresql@15

# Kill conflicting processes
sudo lsof -ti:5432 | xargs kill -9

# Fix data directory permissions
chown -R $USER ~/.local/share/pantry/services/

# Reset service configuration
rm ~/.local/share/pantry/services/config/postgres.conf
pantry start postgres  # Regenerates default config
```

### Service Health Check Failures

**Symptoms**: Service shows as "failed" or "unknown" status
**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Test health check manually
pg_isready -p 5432
redis-cli ping

# Check if health check tools are installed
which pg_isready
which redis-cli
```

**Solutions**:

```bash
# Install missing health check tools
pantry install postgresql@15  # Includes pg_isready
pantry install redis@7        # Includes redis-cli

# Test service manually
telnet localhost 5432  # Test basic connectivity
```

### Service Auto-Start Issues

**Symptoms**: Services don't start automatically
**Platform-Specific Diagnosis**:

#### macOS (launchd)

```bash
# Check launchd status
launchctl list | grep com.pantry

# Check plist file
cat ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pantry.postgres.plist

# Manual launchd operations
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.pantry.postgres.plist
launchctl start com.pantry.postgres
```

#### Linux (systemd)

```bash
# Check systemd status
systemctl --user status pantry-postgres

# Check service logs
journalctl --user -u pantry-postgres

# Manual systemd operations
systemctl --user enable pantry-postgres
systemctl --user start pantry-postgres
```

### Service Configuration Issues

**Symptoms**: Service starts but behaves incorrectly
**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Check generated configuration
cat ~/.local/share/pantry/services/config/redis.conf
cat ~/.local/share/pantry/services/config/nginx.conf

# Validate configuration syntax
nginx -t -c ~/.local/share/pantry/services/config/nginx.conf
```

**Solutions**:

```bash
# Regenerate default configuration
rm ~/.local/share/pantry/services/config/redis.conf
pantry restart redis

# Edit configuration manually
nano ~/.local/share/pantry/services/config/redis.conf
pantry restart redis
```

### Platform-Specific Service Issues

#### Windows

Service management is not supported on Windows. Services must be run manually:

```bash
# Run services manually on Windows
postgres -D data/
redis-server redis.conf
```

#### macOS Permission Issues

```bash
# Grant full disk access to Terminal.app
# System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Full Disk Access

# Check Console.app for launchd errors
# Applications > Utilities > Console.app
```

#### Linux systemd Issues

```bash
# Enable systemd user services
sudo systemctl enable systemd-logind
loginctl enable-linger $USER

# Reload systemd configuration
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

### Service Data and Log Issues

**Symptoms**: Services lose data or logs are missing
**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Check data directories
ls -la ~/.local/share/pantry/services/
du -sh ~/.local/share/pantry/services/_/

# Check log files
ls -la ~/.local/share/pantry/logs/
tail -f ~/.local/share/pantry/logs/_.log
```

**Solutions**:

```bash
# Create missing directories
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/pantry/services/postgres/data
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/pantry/logs

# Fix permissions
chown -R $USER ~/.local/share/pantry/
chmod -R 755 ~/.local/share/pantry/

# Backup data before troubleshooting
tar -czf services-backup.tar.gz ~/.local/share/pantry/services/
```

### Service Network and Port Issues

**Symptoms**: Can't connect to service ports
**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Check if ports are listening
netstat -an | grep 5432
lsof -i :5432

# Check firewall rules (Linux)
sudo ufw status
sudo iptables -L

# Test connectivity
telnet localhost 5432
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

**Solutions**:

```bash
# Kill processes using conflicting ports
sudo lsof -ti:5432 | xargs kill -9

# Configure firewall (if needed)
sudo ufw allow 5432/tcp

# Change service port in configuration
nano ~/.local/share/pantry/services/config/postgres.conf
# Change: port = 5433
pantry restart postgres
```

### Service Management Commands Not Working

**Symptoms**: `pantry service` commands fail
**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Check if service management is enabled
echo $pantry_SERVICES_ENABLED

# Check platform support
pantry services  # Should show available services
```

**Solutions**:

```bash
# Enable service management
export pantry_SERVICES_ENABLED=true

# On unsupported platforms, services must be run manually
# Use Docker or other container solutions for service management
```
